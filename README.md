# Data Security and Compliance Solution
With increasing data breaches and stringent industry regulations, ensuring data security and compliance has become a top priority for organizations. Protecting sensitive data and complying with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA requires robust security measures and continuous monitoring.

## Sample Scenario - MadHatter Corp.
Our solution focuses on ensuring data security and compliance using AWS services. We leverage AWS IAM for access control, AWS KMS for data encryption, Amazon Macie for sensitive data discovery and classification, and AWS CloudTrail for logging and auditing. By integrating these services, we ensure that our data is secure, access is controlled, sensitive information is identified and protected, and all activities are logged for compliance and auditing purposes.
